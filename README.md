<h1>Project Abstract:</h1>
  
This project is a simple Django-based web application designed to demonstrate the use of various views and template rendering techniques. It includes several routes that showcase different types of HTTP responses and interactions between views, templates, and context data.<br>

<h1>Key features</h1>

**1.Basic View:**Functions such as demo and check provide basic HTTP responses, rendering simple text in the browser.<br>
**2.Template Rendering:** Views like use, wait, and won render HTML templates (form.html, table.html, and list.html) to the user.<br>
**3.Contextual Rendering:** The first view demonstrates how to pass variables into templates, allowing dynamic content rendering. The index view passes a list of programming courses into the template, which is displayed to the user.<br>
**4.Data Display:** The total view sends a list of subject marks (as dictionaries) to the template, showcasing how Django templates can loop through data and present it in a formatted way.<br>
This project provides a fundamental understanding of handling HTTP responses, rendering HTML templates, and passing dynamic data in Django applications. It is aimed at beginners learning Django's core concepts.
